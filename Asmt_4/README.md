# Direct Mapping Cache Memory

**Objective:**

To simulate reading and writing to a custom-sized direct-mapped cache, involving a
custom-sized main memory.

**Inputs:**
- The total size of accessible main memory (in words)
- The total size of the cache (in words) and the block size (words/block)
- A signal to read (0) or write (1) to the cache
- The main memory address to read from/write to
- The contents of the address for writing to the cache (data)

**Outputs:**
- The corresponding cache tag, block, and word for a main memory address
- The contents of the address resulting from reading/writing to the cache
- A message indicating either a hit or a miss to the cache

**Specification:**
- The program simulates reading from and writing to a direct-mapped cache based on
choosing from a menu of choices, where each choice calls the appropriate procedure,
where the choices are:
1) Enter parameters
2) Access cache for reading/writing and transfer data
3) Quit program

**What to do:**
- Use a structure (struct) to represent a cache line consisting of a tag (integer) and a
block (integer pointer). Define the cache to be a pointer to the struct.
- Upon entering the parameters, the main memory and cache are to be dynamically
allocated based on their respective total sizes. Each word i of main memory is
initialized with the value M+i, where M is the size of main memory in words. For
example, if the memory size is 16384, then word 10 will initially contain the value
16394 (which is 16384+10).
- Reading/writing from/to a new block in the cache results in dynamically allocating
the block based on the block size.

**What NOT to do (any violation will result in an automatic score of 0 on the assignment):**
- Do NOT modify the choice values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) or input characters and then try to convert
them to integers--the test script used for grading your assignment will not work correctly.
- Do NOT turn in an outdated version of the assignment downloaded from the Internet
(coursehero, github, etc.) or a version that was coded by someone else (former student, tutor,
etc.)
- Do NOT use any self-created or external libraries that cannot be located/utilized by zylabs
- Do NOT turn in your assignment coded in another programming language (C++, C#, Java,
Python, Perl, etc.)â€”it will NOT compile under zyLabs C compiler.
